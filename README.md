# AI4Bharat-Data-Engineering-Internship-Tasks
Codes and Files related to the coding assignment for the data engineering internship at AI4Bharat<br/>

Detailed Readme regarding task 1 is available in the folder itself.<br/>

Regarding Task2 **AI4Bharat Internship Data Engineering Task2** notebook has been uploaded with detailed comments for clarity and the pdf_extract.json is sent in the response email.<br/> 
The structure of the json is as follows:<br/><br/>
{<br/>
  "page_url":url,<br/>
  "pdf_url":pdf_url, <br/>
  "paragraph": pdf-content }      (Here pdf-content is stored as a dictionary with pageno. as key and the text extracted from that page as value)<br/><br/>
<br/>
(Made the mistake of keeping key as paragraph instead of pdf-content)<br/>
